The objective of this program is to make it easier to pull recent stock information and manipulate that information in Excel.  The user will use the input of a stock ticker and enter it into the application,  and the output will be the most recent stock prices for the last 30 days, which will display on screen.  In addition, the program will write this data to a csv file, where the user can easily manipulate it by sorting the data, filtering it, or perhaps even making a chart or a graph.
